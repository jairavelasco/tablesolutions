                    <h1>Welcome to Table Solutions, your go to solution for table top gaming!</h1><br>
                    <h5>Tired of your board game shelf filling up with unessecarily large boxes?</h5><br>
                    <h5>Tired of realizing the instruction manual is lost at the critical points of your games?</h5><br>
                    <h5>Tired of your party going somewhere you don't have a battle map built for?</h5><br>
                    <p>Well look no further! Whether you are in the board game community, a hardcore TTRPG (Table Top Role Playing Games) player, or simply someone looking for a fun way to play games with family and friends, Table Solutions is for you! Our product
                        opens the gateways for table top gamers to better their gameplay while reducing the storage space required for boards, instructions, and battle maps!</p>
                    <p>We create tables containing a screen that allows users to connect their laptops to. This screen will be able to show boards for board games or maps for table top games. This will allow for users to reduce the storage space of games down
                        to a smaller box containing just the pieces required for the game and removing the need for a large box to fit the board itself. This not only allows you to save on storage space, it also makes the transportation of games much easier
                        as long as your friends or family also have a games table.</p>
                    <p>Our goal is to have a more interactive gameplay experience, while maintaining the great feeling of a board game. For RPG players, our desire is to allow a Game Master to create a more interactive experience by having a plethora of maps
                        available. This allows players to have more freedom in an open world, without a Game Master being stressed trying to find a batllemap that might suit the situation. It also allows for dungeons to be revealed as a party moves through
                        it, simulating a feeling of actually being in the dungeon!</p>
                    <p></p>
